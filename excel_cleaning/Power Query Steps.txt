# Superstore Dataset – Data Cleaning using Excel (Power Query)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Superstore dataset using Excel Power Query. 
The goal was to improve data quality, ensure consistency, and make the dataset analysis-ready 
before performing any reporting or visualization.

---

## Dataset Details
- Source: Kaggle (Superstore Dataset)
- Original Rows: 9,994
- Original Columns: 21
- Final Rows After Cleaning: 9,986
- Tool Used: Microsoft Excel (Power Query)

---

## Step-by-Step Work Done

### Step 1: Data Backup
- Created a backup of the original CSV/Excel file before starting any cleaning activities.
- Ensured data safety and rollback capability.

---

### Step 2: Load Data into Power Query
- Imported the dataset into Excel Power Query Editor.
- Reviewed the initial structure and column layout.

---

### Step 3: Remove Irrelevant Column
- Removed the `Row ID` column as it only represented row numbers.
- This column had no analytical value.

---

### Step 4: Verify and Correct Data Types
- Verified data types for all remaining 20 columns.
- Converted:
  - `Sales` → Currency
  - `Profit` → Currency
- Verified `Quantity` as Whole Number and `Discount` as Percentage.

---

### Step 5: Clean Text Columns
- Selected all text-based columns.
- Applied:
  - **Trim** → removed leading and trailing spaces
  - **Clean** → removed hidden and non-printable characters

---

### Step 6: Data Quality Validation
- Enabled **Column Quality** and **Column Distribution** options.
- Verified:
  - 100% valid values in all columns
  - No null or error values present

---

### Step 7: Remove Duplicate Records
- Identified duplicates using a composite key:
  - `Order ID` + `Product ID`
- Removed exact duplicate rows.
- Total duplicates removed: 6 rows

---

### Step 8: Feature Engineering – Delivery Days
- Created a new custom column `Delivery Days` using:
  - `Duration.Days([Ship Date] - [Order Date])`
- This converted date information into a measurable performance metric.

---

### Step 9: Standardize Categorical Data
- Standardized categorical columns for consistency:
  - Category
  - Sub Category
  - Segment
  - Shipping Mode
  - Region
  - State
  - City
  - Country
- Applied **Capitalize Each Word** formatting.

---

### Step 10: Rename Columns for Clarity
- Renamed columns to improve readability:
  - `Ship Mode` → `Shipping Mode`
  - `Sub-Category` → `Sub Category`

---

### Step 11: Final Validation
- Re-checked data types and column values.
- Ensured no empty cells, duplicates, or formatting issues remained.

---

### Step 12: Close and Load
- Loaded the cleaned dataset back into Excel.
- Final dataset ready for analysis and visualization.

---

## Outcome
- Improved data consistency and structure.
- Eliminated duplicates and formatting issues.
- Dataset is now reliable and analysis-ready.
